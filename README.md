# Random-Square-Generator
Its a simple application which generate a random number and perform its square

I have built this application in Kotlin using concepts such as String Templates, Lambdas and Higher-Order Functions. This application 
has a text view and a button. I default text will be "Hello User!" and the button has a text as "Generate". Whenever the user clicks 
the button, the application generates a random number and it calculates its square and prints in the text view.
